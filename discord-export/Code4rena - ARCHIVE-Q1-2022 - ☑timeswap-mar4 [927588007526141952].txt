Hello everyone :astroburn: 

Great to be here with Day-1 of our code4ena Timeswap smart contract audit contest going live :pepedance: 

Best wishes to the wardens who would be hunting for the bugs in the contest :pepehappyhands:


[04-Jan-22 12:19 AM] ACai#1706
Excuse me, I wonder if the scope of timeswap audit is only 7 contracts which mentioned in https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-01-timeswap-contest. Does it include other contracts such as libraries or interfaces？

[04-Jan-22 02:24 AM] amateur-dev#8892
Hi

The collateral to be added has two components minimum collateral and additional collateral.

"Delta ZMax" is essentially the minimum collateral and deltaZ*d/2^25 is the additional collateral that you choose to lock as a borrower. As a borrower, you always have to lock the minimum collateral of delta ZMax (when you choose additional collateral to be locked as zero i.e. deltaZ=0 which makes deltaZ*d/2^25=0 ). On top of this you as a borrower can decide to lock an additional collateral. The more you increase this additional collateral (essentially deltaZ) lesser is the interest or debt (deltaY, owing to constant product XYZ=K) you have to pay as a borrower.


[04-Jan-22 03:30 AM] danb#6193
Thanks!


[04-Jan-22 05:39 AM] VinnyChase#8355
So as a borrower, Delta Z max does not change the constant product formula? Only the second component of collateral changes (additional collat) the constant prod forumla?


[04-Jan-22 07:10 AM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
Yes Delta Z max does not change the constant product formula.

[04-Jan-22 01:37 PM] VinnyChase#8355
Just to clarify: this (line 5) should definitely be x/z and not z/x?

[04-Jan-22 07:36 PM] cryptodog#2063
I have always confused for the Y Interest Rate Parameter, In my understanding the Interest Rate Parameter should be : Interest Amount = Borrow Principal Amount * Interest Rate * Duration @amateur-dev  But here the Y Multiply by
Duration is equal Interest Amount

[04-Jan-22 07:38 PM] cryptodog#2063
Any formula to calculate the current Delta Z?


[04-Jan-22 07:43 PM] cryptodog#2063
The is correct: X is the principal, the Z is the collateral, Z/X means how much collateral are backed for the per X principal


[04-Jan-22 07:50 PM] amateur-dev#8892
Hi Guys. Replying to the questions shortly.


[04-Jan-22 08:17 PM] amateur-dev#8892
This is because the 0.00000316 is already computed by multiplying the principal amount (1000) multiplied by the interest rate per second (cause we are dividing the 10% to the number of seconds in a year)


[04-Jan-22 08:18 PM] amateur-dev#8892
For this the first step to compute the Max Value of Z --> which is in-turn derived by considering the "K" constant product and then assuming the Delta Y to be 0.


[04-Jan-22 08:27 PM] cryptodog#2063
I know that Y is already computed by multiplying the principal amount, but why this make me confuse is because the initial state of pool, X, Y, Z, are the Y here are also multiplying the princal amount 10,000? So in the pool state change, every Y is computed by the current X...I think this is reallly obscure

[04-Jan-22 08:37 PM] amateur-dev#8892
Sure, I will help on that.  Just out of curiosity are you looking at a Borrow Tx or Lending Tx.  While the calculations largely remain the same, there are only smaller nitty-gritties that I do not want to ignore when giving you the exact formula


[04-Jan-22 08:37 PM] cryptodog#2063
I was looking the Borrow Tx Part


[04-Jan-22 09:14 PM] amateur-dev#8892
Reverting. Will edit this message with the computation and explanation.  Just heads-up


[04-Jan-22 10:19 PM] amateur-dev#8892
Pool state change Y is not computed by multiplying by current X. It automatically changes after every transaction based on constant product K and user values of interest (based on deltaY ) and Collateral/insurance (based on deltaZ )

In the eg here with Y=0.000475, you can calculate APR by multiplying by X and duration of a year. Rest state Y will "only" change based on K and deltaX,DeltaZ values after each tx.

I will draw your reference to the gitbook where we have a computation: https://timeswap.gitbook.io/timeswap/deep-dive/borrowing.  As you will follow the math over here.  The DeltaZmax will be at the maximum value, when the DeltaY = 0.

OK, got it


[05-Jan-22 08:11 AM] Rhynorater#6461
For this graph, the LP gets  back a Collateralized-Debt Token as well. This is not explained in the below description. Could you provide some clarity as to how this token is different than the one used by the borrower and what function it serves in the overall system?

[05-Jan-22 08:21 AM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
The CDT that borrowers received and LPs received are practically the same. The design is such that since LPs have both lend positions and borrow positions. The CDT is represent the borrow position of the LP.


[05-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Rhynorater#6461
So what happens when the LP burns their CDT? @Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap ?


[05-Jan-22 08:30 AM] Rhynorater#6461
For the borrower, the debt has to be repayed before the CDT is burned. How about for the LP?


[05-Jan-22 08:48 AM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
Same rules, the LP has to pay back the debt to withdraw that collateral.


[05-Jan-22 08:49 AM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
A contract could be created to do flash swap, so that there is no need for capital to pay back the debt to withdraw collateral assuming the value of debt is less than the collateral near maturity.


[05-Jan-22 12:02 PM] Rhynorater#6461
What debt is does the LP have? I thought the LP was simply providing back liquidity? Is the Liquidity Token that the LP gets for contributing considered a debt of LT?


[05-Jan-22 12:03 PM] Rhynorater#6461
In the above graph, the only thing that the LP gets back is a CDT and LTs, right?


[05-Jan-22 07:34 PM] amateur-dev#8892
An LP actually provides both sides of the equation.  He providers the "asset" {like a lender} and also the collateral {like a borrower}.  Hope this helps.


[06-Jan-22 12:28 AM] cryptodog#2063
In this explanation, what is the difference between LT token and IT/BT, cuase the liquidity provider don't get any IT/BT token as the lender? whilte LP provider get the CDT as borrower


[06-Jan-22 02:38 AM] amateur-dev#8892
For a Lender the BT represents the asset portion and the IT represents the collateral token.  Once the Lender liquidates, both or either of IT, BT tokens are exchanged for the underlying asset / collateral position.  

However, in the case of a LiquidityProvider, LT represents all the remaining amount of asset and collateral, after all the necessary tokens for the LPs are accounted for. That's why LT are fungible.


[06-Jan-22 04:15 AM] Rhynorater#6461
Ok so the LP locks collateral (WETH) like a borrower but NOT get DAI back like a borrower. So what debt must be paid before the LP can burn the CDT? There is no debt since the LP did nothing but provide not receive.


[06-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
The debt is is like saying I am creating a debt so that lenders can join and lend. The debt is a promise to lenders that they should expect asset returns, given that the collateral that they deposited is backing that debt.


[06-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Rhynorater#6461
Ok, I think I get it now. That's an interesting use of the term debt, but I see how it there isn't really a better word for the situation 😂


[06-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
Yeah, took me so much time to think of better terms as well, but end up back to the term debt.


[06-Jan-22 08:58 AM] Rhynorater#6461
So, just to confirm, since all these libraries are out of scope, you dont want us to check for math errors? Or should we be looking for anything that will have an impact to the in-scope contracts?


[06-Jan-22 09:59 AM] Rhynorater#6461
```
/// @notice All error messages are coded and can be found in the documentation.
```
Where are these error messages defined?


[06-Jan-22 10:20 AM] VinnyChase#8355
In the repo in ErrorCodes.md @Rhynorater


[06-Jan-22 10:35 AM] Rhynorater#6461
Thanks, missed that.


[06-Jan-22 11:16 AM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
The libraries are included. Sorry if that is unclear.


[06-Jan-22 11:24 AM] Rhynorater#6461
Ok gotcha


[06-Jan-22 11:40 AM] VinnyChase#8355
In the borrow math lib, in particular:
```
    function getCollateral(
        uint256 maturity,
        IPair.State memory state,
        uint112 xDecrease,
        uint112 zIncrease
    ) internal view returns (uint112 collateralIn) {
        uint256 _collateralIn = maturity;
        _collateralIn -= block.timestamp;
        _collateralIn *= zIncrease;
        _collateralIn = _collateralIn.shiftRightUp(25);
        uint256 minimum = state.z;
        minimum *= xDecrease;
        uint256 denominator = state.x;
        denominator -= xDecrease;
        minimum = minimum.divUp(denominator);
        _collateralIn += minimum;
        collateralIn = _collateralIn.toUint112();
    }
```
Is minimum supposed to represent Z max where dy = 0?


[06-Jan-22 11:58 AM] Rhynorater#6461
Was wondering the same thing in LendMath for getInsurance


[06-Jan-22 12:01 PM] Rhynorater#6461
Using the terms from the gitbook: `(d*z/2^25) + (Z*x)/(X+x)` is what is being returned from `getInsurance`, which doesn't appear to be mathematically eqiv to `z_{max}+zd/2^25` unless `zMax` is = `(Z*x)/(X+x)` which it is not as far as I know.  It would be helpful if I could run some tests on some of this stuff, but I'm not sure how you are representing floating points in this (probably my lack of experience with Solidity), but I've got all the math implemented in Python so I'd like to check.


[06-Jan-22 04:11 PM] Dravee#7832
Hello! Here it's said that libraries are not in scope. But just above, it says the opposite. What is true?


[06-Jan-22 04:12 PM] Dravee#7832

[06-Jan-22 05:55 PM] amateur-dev#8892

[06-Jan-22 06:54 PM] cryptodog#2063
Can I use your gamified testnet to explain the situation? Like the MATIC-AVAX pool, the APR is high, so when the maturity come, how much can the lenders  and liquidity provider get back?

You can see the initial asset/collateral and the current stats


[06-Jan-22 06:56 PM] cryptodog#2063
How will happen in the maturity time?


[06-Jan-22 07:07 PM] amateur-dev#8892
Let me put down these numbers in an excel file, 1 min


[06-Jan-22 07:23 PM] cryptodog#2063
OK, also I test to lend I MATIC in the pool with highest apr to get the responding IT/BT, but not sure how much I can get back when maturity


[06-Jan-22 07:25 PM] amateur-dev#8892
At maturity, it depends if the pool is paid-back or not.  That will have an impact.


[06-Jan-22 07:26 PM] cryptodog#2063
what is the paid-back or not mean?


[06-Jan-22 07:27 PM] amateur-dev#8892
Meaning, if all the borrowers paid back their dues


[06-Jan-22 07:28 PM] amateur-dev#8892
If the borrowers honoured their debt, then the bond tokens will get you back the asset and insurance token will not get you back the collateral; and vice-versa


[06-Jan-22 07:28 PM] cryptodog#2063
Most of the borrowers will not paid back


[06-Jan-22 07:29 PM] cryptodog#2063
From the pool stats, the initial MATIC and current has huge difference


[06-Jan-22 07:31 PM] cryptodog#2063
If all borrowerrs are not paid back, how will the default calculate every lenders position and liquidity provider position


[07-Jan-22 11:30 PM] Timelord.eth ⌛ || Timeswap#6577
So the bond tokens will yield any remaining amount of asset in the pool (which will be very small amount because most borrowers defaulted). The insurance on the other hand will yield the collateral left by all those borrowers. Finally any remaining amount of asset and collateral will go to LPS.


[10-Jan-22 08:18 AM] Rhynorater#6461
