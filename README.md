# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts

The protocol does not use an oracle for collateral factor calculation. Instead, it utilizes a `xyz=k` constant product algorithm to discover both interest rate and collateral factor. x and y determines interest rate, while x and z determines collateral factor. Whenever the ratio of x, y, and z are not up to market rate, then it means it is a favorable price for a lender or borrower.

## Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?

The following token contracts in the Convenience Repository follow the token standard:
- BondPrincipal ERC20, 
- BondInterest ERC20,
- InsurancePrincipal ERC20, 
- InsuranceInterest ERC20, 
- Liquidity ERC20, and 
- Collateralized Debt ERC721

The key difference they have is that they don‚Äôt store total supply in the contract, instead the respective claims (bond tokens and insurance tokens), dues, and liquidity balanceOf of those ERC20 and ERC721 contracts are the total supply.
