## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts

The protocol does not use an oracle for collateral factor calculation. Instead, it utilizes a `xyz=k` constant product algorithm to discover both interest rate and collateral factor. x and y determines interest rate, while x and z determines collateral factor. Whenever the ratio of x, y, and z are not up to market rate, then it means it is a favorable price for a lender or borrower.

### Note

This is a follow-up to our January Code4rena contest. Our goal is to review the mitigations we have made since.  The findings from the earlier contest can be found over [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap-findings).

## Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?

The following token contracts in the Convenience Repository follow the token standard:
- BondPrincipal ERC20, 
- BondInterest ERC20,
- InsurancePrincipal ERC20, 
- InsuranceInterest ERC20, 
- Liquidity ERC20, and 
- Collateralized Debt ERC721

The key difference they have is that they donâ€™t store total supply in the contract, instead the respective claims (bond tokens and insurance tokens), dues, and liquidity balanceOf of those ERC20 and ERC721 contracts are the total supply.
